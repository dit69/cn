Star Topology

Advantages: Easy to set up, isolate faults, and expand; failure of one node doesn’t affect others.
Disadvantages: Single point of failure (hub); requires more cable.
Ring Topology

Advantages: Data flows in one direction, reducing collisions; simple installation.
Disadvantages: If one device fails, the entire network can go down; slower with large networks.
Bus Topology

Advantages: Easy to install; uses less cable, so it’s cost-effective.
Disadvantages: Limited cable length; a fault in the main cable disrupts the network.
Mesh Topology

Advantages: High reliability; multiple paths for data, so no single point of failure.
Disadvantages: Expensive and complex to install due to high cable requirements.
